# Reduction strategies for untyped lambda calculus

Here is some code I used while thinking about reduction strategies for the
untyped lambda calculus.  The code is in
[pure](https://bitbucket.org/purelang/pure-lang), a term rewriting language.
So... that's kinda cool, a lambda calculus evaluator written in a term
rewriting language!  Or maybe it's not that uncommon, I don't know.  In any
case, the language is pretty cool, and I learned a lot about reduction
strategies for the lambda calculus.

The strategies themselves are mostly taken from [some notes on
such](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6110/2014sp/handouts/sestoft.pdf).
I also consulted Wikipedia heavily.  So, you know, you get what you pay for.
Read about it on my blog.
